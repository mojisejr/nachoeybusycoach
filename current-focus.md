# Current Focus: Phase 2 - Directory Structure Setup

**Created**: 2025-09-11 07:00:00  
**Context**: Phase 2 of frontend-backend merge plan from merge-plan.md

## Current Focus

Implementing Phase 2 of the frontend-backend merge: Directory Structure Setup. Phase 1 has been successfully completed with all success criteria met.

## Phase 1 Completion Status ✅
- ✅ Complete backup created and verified (merge-frontend-backend branch)
- ✅ All dependencies documented with versions (package.json structure established)
- ✅ Potential conflicts identified and categorized (monorepo with pnpm workspaces)
- ✅ Development branch created and tested (currently on merge-frontend-backend)
- ✅ Team has access to rollback procedures (backup branches available)

## Phase 2 Objectives (Context: ~75k tokens)
- Create unified directory structure in backend app
- Prepare destination folders for frontend components migration
- Set up shared packages integration
- Ensure path aliases working correctly

## Phase 2 Tasks (from merge-plan.md)

### 2.1 Create Unified Structure in Backend
```
apps/backend/src/
├── app/
│   ├── (auth)/          # Auth-related pages
│   ├── (dashboard)/     # Dashboard pages (from frontend)
│   ├── api/             # Existing API routes
│   ├── auth/            # Existing auth pages
│   ├── studio/          # Sanity studio
│   └── globals.css      # Merged styles
├── components/          # Merged UI components
│   ├── ui/              # Shared UI components
│   ├── forms/           # Form components
│   ├── dashboard/       # Dashboard-specific components
│   └── auth/            # Auth components
├── hooks/               # Merged custom hooks
├── lib/                 # Merged utilities
│   ├── auth.ts          # Existing auth config
│   ├── sanity.ts        # Existing Sanity config
│   ├── api.ts           # API utilities (from frontend)
│   ├── validations/     # Existing validations
│   └── utils.ts         # General utilities
├── services/            # API services (from frontend)
├── store/               # State management (from frontend)
├── types/               # Merged type definitions
└── utils/               # Utility functions
```

### 2.2 Directory Creation
- [ ] Create missing directories in backend
- [ ] Set up proper folder permissions
- [ ] Initialize index files where needed

### 2.3 Shared Packages Integration
- [ ] Update imports to use shared packages
- [ ] Verify package dependencies
- [ ] Test shared package accessibility

## Phase 2 Success Criteria
- ✅ All required directories created with proper permissions
- ✅ Path aliases working correctly in TypeScript
- ✅ .gitignore properly excludes unnecessary files
- ✅ Directory structure matches planned architecture
- ✅ No broken imports or path references

## Current Project State
- **Branch**: merge-frontend-backend
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces configured
- **Apps**: frontend (port 3000), backend (port 3001)
- **Dependencies**: Next.js 15.5.2, React 19, established packages
- **Status**: Clean working tree, ready for Phase 2 implementation

## Next Steps
1. Analyze current backend directory structure
2. Create missing directories according to the unified structure
3. Set up proper index files and path aliases
4. Verify shared packages integration
5. Test directory structure and imports
