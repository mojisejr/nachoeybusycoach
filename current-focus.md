# Current Focus: Login System Debugging with Enhanced Context

**Created**: 2025-09-10 16:47:12 (Updated: 2025-09-10)
**Context**: From retrospective analysis, multiple complex React hooks violations in login system requiring systematic approach with latest documentation

## Issue Summary
From `/docs/retrospective/2025-09-10-useauth-hooks-order-debugging-session.md`, there are persistent React hooks order violations in the `useAuth` hook causing LoginPage crashes with "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" errors.

## Key Problems Identified
1. **Critical React Hooks Violation**: useEffect calls after conditional returns in useAuth.ts
2. **Dependency Array Instability**: useEffect dependencies change between renders during hydration 
3. **Conditional Hook Execution**: useEffect at line 107 called conditionally based on render state
4. **SessionProvider Context Issues**: Secondary authentication flow problems

## Root Cause Analysis
The retrospective reveals the REAL problem is NOT just useState reordering, but **CONDITIONAL useEffect EXECUTION** within the useAuth hook:

```tsx
// PROBLEMATIC STRUCTURE:
useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true);
}, []);

// Early return during hydration
if (!mounted) {
  return { /* stable values */ };
}

// MORE useEffect calls AFTER conditional return - PROBLEM!
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated && !isLoading) {
    fetchProfile();
    fetchRole();
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, isLoading]); // <- Line 107, dependency array changes
```

During hydration:
- First render: `[false, undefined]` 
- Second render: `[false, true]`
- Third render: `[true, false]`

This violates React's expectation of consistent hook order and dependency arrays.

## Strategy Enhancement
Previous session attempted multiple failed approaches. Need to:

1. **Use Context7** âœ… - Gathered latest NextAuth.js documentation on proper hook patterns
2. **Use Playwright** - Visualize current UI state and authentication flow
3. **Complete systematic analysis** - Frontend login implementation analysis
4. **Create comprehensive plan** - Based on latest best practices

## Context Enhancement Goals
- âœ… Latest NextAuth.js App Router + useSession patterns gathered
- âœ… Current hydration best practices documented  
- ðŸ”„ Visualize actual UI behavior during authentication
- ðŸ”„ Document proper hook architecture for complex auth flows

## Next Steps
1. Launch Playwright to see current login UI state
2. Analyze frontend authentication implementation systematically  
3. Create detailed plan based on Context7 insights and visual analysis
4. Implement complete useAuth hook rewrite following React rules

**Status**: Research phase - gathering enhanced context before implementation
