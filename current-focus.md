## Context

From `/Users/non/dev/vibes/nachoeybusycoach/resources/BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` implement sub-phase 2.1 focus testing on google first and leave facebook their because I haven't set up the .env for facebook yet

## Implementation Focus

- **Phase:** Sub-Phase 2.1 - NextAuth.js Setup (เช้า)
- **Goal:** ตั้งค่าระบบ Authentication
- **Priority:** Google OAuth implementation and testing
- **Status:** Facebook OAuth setup deferred (missing .env configuration)

## Key Tasks

1. Install and configure NextAuth.js dependencies
2. Create NextAuth configuration with Google Provider (priority)
3. Set up authentication middleware
4. Manual testing with Google OAuth
5. Skip Facebook testing until .env is properly configured

## Notes

- Focus on Google authentication first for immediate testing
- Facebook provider code can be included but testing deferred
- Ensure proper session handling and user role management
- Test authentication flow thoroughly before proceeding
