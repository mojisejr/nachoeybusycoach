# Phase 1: Preparation and Backup - Frontend-Backend Merge

**Created**: 2025-09-10 16:47:12 (Updated: 2025-09-10 19:30:00)
**Context**: Beginning Phase 1 of comprehensive frontend-backend merge plan from merge-plan.md

## Current Focus

Implementing Phase 1 of the systematic merge process to consolidate separate frontend and backend Next.js applications into a single fullstack application. This phase prioritizes safety through comprehensive backup and preparation.

## Phase 1 Objectives (Context: ~50k tokens)

- Create backup of current state
- Analyze dependencies and conflicts  
- Prepare merge environment
- Document current architecture for safe migration

## Phase 1 Tasks

### 1.1 Backup Current State
```bash
# Create backup branch
git checkout -b backup-before-merge
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before frontend-backend merge"
git push origin backup-before-merge
```

### 1.2 Dependency Analysis
- [ ] Compare `package.json` files between apps/frontend and apps/backend
- [ ] Identify conflicting dependencies and version mismatches
- [ ] Plan dependency resolution strategy
- [ ] Document version conflicts for safe resolution

### 1.3 Environment Setup
- [ ] Create new branch for merge: `git checkout -b merge-frontend-backend`
- [ ] Backup environment files (.env, .env.local)  
- [ ] Document current environment variables mapping

### 1.4 Documentation
- [ ] Document current API endpoints in backend
- [ ] List all frontend routes and pages
- [ ] Map component dependencies between applications
- [ ] Identify shared utilities for consolidation

## Migration Strategy

**Using backend as base** since it already has:
- Authentication system (NextAuth)
- Database integration (Sanity)
- API infrastructure  
- Production-ready configuration

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Complete backup created and verified
- ✅ All dependencies documented with versions
- ✅ Potential conflicts identified and categorized  
- ✅ Development branch created and tested
- ✅ Team has access to rollback procedures

## Risk Management

- **Risk**: Incomplete backup → *Mitigation*: Verify backup integrity, test restore process
- **Risk**: Missing dependency conflicts → *Mitigation*: Use automated tools for dependency analysis
- **Risk**: Development branch corruption → *Mitigation*: Create multiple backup branches, use Git tags
